This night is cold in the kingdom
I can feel you fade away
From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
Your steps keep me awake


Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please


Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly


Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile
As I'm walking down the corridor
And I know we haven't talked in a while
So I'm looking for an open door


Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please


Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly


And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down


Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly




Outrunning karma
That boy, he's such a charmer
All the bugs and their larva
Follow him out to Colorado
Ten dozen hearts in a bag
Their bodies lying
He'll drag them down to Colorado
A modern desperado


And he'll race for miles through the night
He runs because he knows he cannot hide


He's never gonna make it
All the poor people he's forsaken
Karma is always gonna chase him for his lies
It's just a game of waiting
From the church steeple down to Satan
Karma, there's really no escape until he dies


Outrunning karma
That boy can't run no farther
It's the last days of Sparta
Follow him down to meet Apollo


And he'll brace for battle in the night
He'll fight because he knows he cannot hide


He's never gonna make it
All the poor people he's forsaken
Karma is always gonna chase him for his lies
It's just a game of waiting
From the church steeple down to Satan
Karma, there's really no escape until he dies


La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la


He's never gonna make it
All the poor people he's forsaken
Karma is always gonna chase him for his lies
It's just a game of waiting
From the church steeple down to Satan
Karma, there's really no escape until he dies


La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la




I built a friend
With three pieces of plastic and a pen
I made him on the table in the den
I gave him my old cell phone for a head 
And we spent holidays at my house
And we left presents in a stocking
And we bought bolts and things and strings
And a new watch, that's what he got


And we had so much fun together
We knew we'd be friends forever
And we had so much fun together
We had so much fun


Then I left for college in September
And we wept cause we can't be together
So I kept pictures to remember my old friend, my old friend
Then I met this girl at graduation
And forget my oldest creation
And I guess I'll see him next vacation
Send my best, I send my best


And we had so much fun together
We knew we'd be friends forever
And we had so much fun together
We had so much fun


I came home to find him on the table
With a note, scribbled out in pencil
And he wrote
That he just wasn't stable all alone, all alone
Next to him, an empty glass of water
That he spilt
All over the body that I built
It fizzled and it popped
And then it killed, and then it killed


And we had so much fun together
We thought we'd be friends forever
And we had so much fun together
We had so much fun
I built a friend
