Hey! My name is Margaret Jagger and I'd like to say I'm a pretty big nerd when it comes to most things musical and tech. I love to spend my free time messing around with different instruments, and taking long walks with my dogs.

I'm currently a senior at the College of Wooster, combining both of my interests into a computer science and music double major (with a focus on piano performance), and a minor in statistical and data sciences.

Going into my senior year, I'm hoping to research the commonalities found in computers and music, and possibly build my own synthesizer (an electronic music instrument that generates digital audio signals).

Right now, I'm active in several clubs on campus, including the Women's Ultimate Frisbee Team (known as CoW Tippers), Ballroom Dance Club, and the student-run radio station (WOO 91).

I'm currently serving as:

- President of CoW Tippers
- Treasurer of Ballroom Dance Club
- General Manager of WOO 91

Previously, I've held the following positions:

| Position I Held       | Club     | Academic Year     |
| :-------------: | :----------: | :-----------: |
|  Historian | Ballroom Dance Club   | 2019 - 2020    |
| Secretary   | CoW Tippers | 2019 - 2020 |
| Assistant Music Director | WOO 91 | 2019 - 2020 & 2020 - 2021 |
