In December 2017, I started arranging Christmas songs for an event at a local elderly home with two others, forming a clarinet, viola, and cello trio. We played a variety of songs, including both traditional and modern Christmas music. More information about these arrangements can be found [here](/portfolio/christmasTrio)

After performing the Christmas songs as a trio, another friend of mine asked about turning a few of those songs into a duet for violas. These arrangements can be found [here](/portfolio/christmasDuo). It seemed like a fun idea, so I also arranged several of the songs from a trio of a clarinet, viola, and cello into a duet with only two violas.

For each of these arrangements, as they are between two to three people, in addition to a harmonically-pleasing arrangement, I also wanted to be sure to spread out the melody among each part. While it was easier to do with a trio (as each instrument had a much more defined role to play), it was a fun challenge to have two violas dueting each other.
