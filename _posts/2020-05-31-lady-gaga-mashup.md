During the summer of 2018, I decided that I wanted to explore my abilities a little bit. In doing so, I arranged a mashup between two Lady Gaga songs: _Edge of Glory_ and _Paparazzi_.

In doing the Lady Gaga arrangement, I discovered that I liked being able to arrange songs in a way that did not rely on the voicing constraints of instruments. So, I moved on to using Logic Pro X, Apple's in-house DAW (digital audio workstation). It was a different challenge, with different, more complicated restraints than what an instrument was capable of playing. Instead, I had to focus on what parts of a song blended together best. More information about that can be found [here](/portfolio/edgeOfGlory)
