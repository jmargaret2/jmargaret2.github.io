## An Orchestral Mashup
During the summer of 2018, I decided that I wanted to explore my abilities a little bit. In doing so, I arranged a mashup between two Lady Gaga songs: _Edge of Glory_ and _Paparazzi_.

A four-part quartet, there are two violin parts, one cello part, and one double bass (also known: upright bass, string bass, contrabass). The score can be seen [here](/assets/pdfs/ladyGagaScore.pdf).

## Using Apple's DAW Logic Pro

In doing the Lady Gaga arrangement, I discovered that I liked being able to arrange songs in a way that did not rely on the voicing constraints of instruments. So, I moved on to using Logic Pro X, Apple's in-house DAW (digital audio workstation). It was a different challenge, with different, more complicated restraints than what an instrument was capable of playing. Instead, I had to focus on what parts of a song blended together best.

The above image is the workflow from my work on this mashup. The lyrics are below (with a PDF version found [here](/assets/pdfs/edgeOfGloryPaparazziMashupLyrics.pdf)).

[Verse]  
There ain't no reason you and me should be alone \\
Tonight, yeah, baby! (Tonight, yeah, baby!) \\
And I got a reason that you're who should take me home tonight (Tonight) \\
I need a man that thinks it's right when it's so wrong \\
Tonight, yeah, baby! (Tonight, yeah, baby!) \\
Right on the limits where we know we both belong tonight

[Bridge:]  
It's hard to feel the rush, to brush the dangerous \\
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you \\
Where we can both fall far in love

[Chorus:]  
I'm on the edge of glory, and I'm hanging on a moment of truth \\
_(I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me, Papa-Paparazzi)_ \\
Out on the edge of glory, and I'm hanging on a moment with you \\
_(Baby, there's no other superstar, You know that I'll be your, Papa-paparazzi)_  
I'm on the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge, \\
_(Promise I'll be kind, But I won't stop until that boy is mine)_ \\
I'm on the edge of glory, and I'm hanging on a moment with you \\
_(Baby, you'll be famous, Chase you down until you love me, Papa-paparazzi)_ \\
I'm on the edge with you.

[Verse]  
_I'll be a girl backstage at your show \\
Velvet ropes and guitars \\
Yeah, 'cause you're my rock star in between the sets \\
Eyeliner and cigarettes \\
Shadow is burnt, \\
Yellow dance and we turn \\
My lashes are dry \\
Purple teardrops I cry \\
It don't have a price \\
Loving you is cherry pie_

[Bridge:]  
It's hard to feel the rush ​(feel the rush),​ \\
to brush the dangerous ​(dangerous) \\
I'm gonna run right to (I’m gonna run), to the edge with you \\
Where we can both fall far in love

[Chorus:] \\
I'm on the edge of glory, and I'm hanging on a moment of truth \\
_(I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me, Papa-Paparazzi)_ \\
Out on the edge of glory, and I'm hanging on a moment with you \\
_(Baby, there's no other superstar, You know that I'll be your, Papa-paparazzi)_ \\
I'm on the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge, \\
_(Promise I'll be kind, But I won't stop until that boy is mine)_ \\
I'm on the edge of glory, and I'm hanging on a moment with you \\
_(Baby, you'll be famous, Chase you down until you love me, Papa-paparazzi)_ \\
I'm on the edge with you.
