I would classify this as medley, which while it doesn't have the connective flow that many mashups have, this mix goes from the vocal line of one song from another. Featuring Ava Max's song *Sweet But Psycho* and StéLouse's *Sociopath* the two songs fit thematically in a way that I would think as including two people singing about each other, or a third party. More information can be found [here](/portfolio/sweetButPsycho).
