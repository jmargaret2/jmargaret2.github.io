To brush up on my knowledge of Python, I decided to create a keylogger that would write keystrokes into a text file. I used an explanation of keyloggers found [here](https://www.malwarebytes.com/keylogger/), and a brief tutorial found [here](https://www.codespeedy.com/design-a-keylogger-in-python/) as the basis for my keylogger. From there, I expanded on the features and functionality.

More information can be found [here](/portfolio/keylogger).
